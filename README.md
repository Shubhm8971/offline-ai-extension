🧩 Offline AI Chrome Extension

 An example of offline AI-style actions using a lightweight Chrome extension that operates locally within the browser without requiring calls to an external API.
 Ideal for hackathon demos and quick prototyping.

 Features

 For now, all operations are carried out locally using fictitious logic (real AI APIs will be available later):

 Feature Description Synopsis gives back a brief fictitious synopsis of the chosen text.
 Translate displays the highlighted text's placeholder translation.
 Proofread offers basic spelling and grammar corrections.
 Rewrite displays a revised version of the text.
 Multimodal transcription displays a mock response or sample transcript after accepting an image or audio upload.
 Configuration placeholder for the theme and preferences of a future configuration.

 For the time being, all processing is local, which is perfect for UI/UX testing without incurring API fees or raising privacy issues.

 Tech Stack

 JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

 The Chrome Extensions API (Manifest V3) is made to allow for the eventual plugging in of actual AI APIs.

 🌱 Roadmap

  When Chrome Built-in AI (Gemini Nano) is made available to the public, integrate it.

  Include language and tone settings that can be changed by the user.

  Use React to enhance user interface (work in progress).
