Offline AI Extension

🚀 Offline AI Extension is a Chrome extension that lets you summarize, translate, proofread, rewrite, and transcribe text and media directly on any webpage — all without needing to copy-paste into a separate app. It also supports custom user templates for flexible workflows.

✨ Features

Summarize – Generate concise summaries of highlighted text.

Translate – Instantly translate selected text into your chosen language.

Proofread – Correct grammar, spelling, and style issues in text.

Rewrite – Rephrase text while preserving meaning and improving clarity.

Transcribe – Upload audio files for transcription.

Image/Audio Upload – Upload files for processing (mock integration).

Custom Templates (New!) – Define your own prompts to extend functionality.

Mock Outputs – Fully working demo flow with simulated AI responses.

🛠️ Built With

JavaScript (core logic & popup interactions)

HTML/CSS (UI & styling)

React (experimental branch) – for a more dynamic frontend integration

🚧 Challenges We Faced

Ensuring the UI remained clean and simple with multiple AI actions.
