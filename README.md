Offline AI Extension

All-in-one AI assistant for your browser – fully offline mock simulation.

Features

This extension currently simulates AI functionality locally (mock outputs), with support for the following features:

Summarize – Condenses selected text into a brief summary.

Translate – Translates text between languages (mock).

Proofread – Checks grammar and spelling (mock).

Rewrite – Rewrites text in a clearer or alternative style (mock).

Transcribe – Upload audio files to simulate transcription.

Upload / Multimodal – Upload image or audio files for mock processing.

⚠️ Note: Currently, all features are simulated locally. Real AI API integration will be added later.
