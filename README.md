# Offline AI Extension

A Chrome extension that demonstrates **fully local AI-like features** (mock summary, translate, proofread, etc.) without relying on any external API calls.  
Built for the Lablab hackathon as a proof-of-concept for privacy-friendly, offline-first AI tools.

## ✨ Features
- **Summarize Selected Text** – Quickly produce a short summary of highlighted content.
- **Translate / Proofread / Rewrite** – Buttons prepared for future real AI integrations.
- **Local Mock AI** – Current version generates a lightweight, on-device “summary” (first couple of sentences) so it works without internet or API keys.
