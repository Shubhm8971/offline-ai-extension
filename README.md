🧠 Offline AI Assistant – Chrome Extension

An AI-powered Chrome extension that performs real-time content enhancement — summarization, translation, proofreading, rewriting, transcription, and file uploads — all locally and privately.

Built with React + Vite for speed, TailwindCSS for styling, and a Python Flask backend for smart text and speech processing.

🚀 Features

✅ Summarize – Condenses long web articles or text selections into clear, concise summaries.
✅ Translate – Translates content into multiple languages (default: English → user-selected).
✅ Proofread – Corrects grammar, punctuation, and clarity errors.
✅ Rewrite – Rephrases text while keeping the original meaning intact.
✅ Transcribe – Converts uploaded audio files into accurate, readable text.
✅ Upload – Allows users to upload images or audio for multimodal input processing.
✅ Custom Templates (Planned) – Users can define their own prompt templates for specialized AI tasks.
✅ Settings (In Progress) – Choose default translation language, theme mode, and summary length preferences.

🧩 Tech Stack
🖥️ Frontend

React 18 + Vite – for fast and modular development

TailwindCSS – clean, responsive UI

TypeScript (TSX) – type safety and scalability

Chrome Extension Manifest v3 – for browser integration

⚙️ Backend

Flask (Python) – lightweight REST API for text and audio processing

CORS Enabled – to handle extension–backend communication

Mock AI Outputs – local testing mode (real AI APIs to be added later)

🔧 Installation & Setup
1️⃣ Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Shubhm8971/offline-ai-extension.git
cd offline-ai-extension/extension

2️⃣ Install dependencies
npm install
npm install --save-dev @types/chrome
